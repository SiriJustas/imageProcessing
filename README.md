imageProcessing

Pure JS library for imageProcessing. Goal was to make a library for patterns (or objects) detection in fron-end - yea it is not a good idea, but who cares, lets make some fun.

## Already done:
### Gaussian blur
### Features from accelerated segment test (FAST)
### RGB to Grayscale 
### Symbols drawing
### Different HAAR features generation and applying

##     Example after few different features applied
